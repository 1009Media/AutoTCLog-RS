# AutoTCLog-RS
Writing timecode logs manually is tedious and time consuming. AutoTCLog gets the worst of it done fast so you only have to fill in the easy parts. This is a Rust port of a program I originally wrote in Python, from now on the old Python version is deprecated, and this is the one I'll update.
